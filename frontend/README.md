# This is my web site (really)

## "Pages"

Like all [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/nextjs) apps, the central element of this site are its "pages". As in PHP, each page represents a single HTTP endpoint, and has all the stuff needed to handle requests for that endpoint.

### `/index.js`

The site home page. Right now, it renders a collection of blog posts, but in the future that may change.

### `/posts/index.js`

Long term home for posts and post archives. Right now basically identical to the home page.

### `/posts/show.js`

Single post view.
